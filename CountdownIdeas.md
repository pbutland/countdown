# Countdown Ideas

**Prompt** I want to measure a human's lifespan in other things and I want some examples.  Such as, how many Olympic games would they see? Or how many generations of fruit flies would exist?  Or how many solar eclipses would occur?  Perhaps how many people will be born in another person’s lifetime or how many people would die?
The idea for this is to build an app which takes a person’s age and then calculates how much longer, on average, they will live for and then allow them to choose a unit of measurement from a list of possibilities.  Be creative and the more humorous (even dark humour) the better.
Don’t worry about what the app will look like as I just want ideas for different ways to measure a human’s lifespan.  Use your wealth of information from the internet.

### Biological Countdown

* [x]  **Heartbeats:** Based on an average heart rate, countdown the estimated number of remaining heartbeats. (e.g., "250,000,000 heartbeats left")
* [x]  **Breaths:** Countdown the number of breaths remaining, based on average respiratory rate.
* [x]  **Blinks:** Countdown the approximate number of times you will blink.
* [x]  **Cell Regeneration:** Countdown how many times your body will have replaced all its cells.
* [x]  **Births** How many more births there will be
* [x]  **Hours of sleep** Countdown how many more hours of sleep
* [x]  **Bathroom breaks** Countdown how many hours on the toilet
* [x]  **Steps** Countdown how many more steps you will take
* [x]  **Steps** Countdown the distance you will walk before you die

### Cosmic & Earthly Countdown

* [x]  **Earth's Travel Through Space:** Display the remaining distance you will travel with the Earth around the Sun. (e.g., "You will travel another 1.5 billion miles through space.")
* [x]  **Number of solar/lunar eclipses**
* [x]  **Moon orbits** (roughly 13 per year)
* [x]  **Mercury:** 0.24 Earth years (much shorter, due to its proximity to the Sun)
* [x]  **Venus:** 0.62 Earth years
* [x]  **Earth:** 1 Earth year (the standard)
* [x]  **Mars:** 1.88 Earth years
* [x]  **Jupiter:** 11.86 Earth years
* [x]  **Saturn:** 29.46 Earth years
* [x]  **Uranus:** 84.01 Earth years
* [x]  **Neptune:** 164.79 Earth years

### Global Statistics Countdown

TBD

### Comparative Timelines

* [x]  **Animal Generations:** Frame your remaining time in terms of how many generations of a short-lived animal (like a fruit fly) could pass.

### Distance
*   **Travel and Distance:** Frame the time in terms of travel. "You have enough time to walk around the Earth 3 times," or, "You could fly to the moon and back... 50 times."

### Esoteric & Philosophical Countdown

* [x]  **Personal "Micro-Century":** Based on the concept that a "micro-century" is 52 minutes and 35.7 seconds (one millionth of a century), countdown how many of these you have left. It turns a long time into a large, rapidly decreasing number.
* [x]  **The Sound of Your Voice:** Estimate the total number of words you have left to speak.

### Random Countdown Ideas

* [x]  **Number of Leap Years Left** How many more February 29ths will they see?
* [x]  **Olympic Games Left** How many Summer/Winter Olympics will occur in their lifetime?
* [x]  **World Cups Left** How many FIFA World Cups or Rugby World Cups will happen?
* [x]  **Full Moons Left** How many full moons will happen?
* [x]  **Friday the 13ths Left** How many Friday the 13ths are left for them?
* [x]  **Presidential Elections Left** How many U.S. presidential elections will take place?
* [x]  **Times Their Birthday Falls on a Weekend** How many more times will their birthday be on a Saturday or Sunday?
* [x]  **Number of Times the Calendar Will Be a Palindrome** (e.g., 02/02/2020)
* [x]  **Number of Times They’ll See a Blue Moon** (A rare second full moon in a calendar month.)
* [x]  **Number of Times the International Space Station Orbits Earth** (ISS orbits Earth about 16 times a day—how many more orbits will happen in their lifetime?)
* [x]  **Number of Times the Olympics Will Be Held in a Leap Year** (Summer Olympics are always in leap years.)
* [x]  **Number of Times the Next Major Comet Will Pass Earth** (e.g., Comet NEOWISE, Comet Leonard.)

### Time based Countdown Ideas

* [x]  **years**
* [x]  **months**
* [x]  **weeks**
* [x]  **days**
* [x]  **hours**
* [x]  **minutes**
* [x]  **seconds**
* [x]  **milliseconds**
* [x]  **jiffy**

### Scientific facts Countdown

* [x]  **Light Travel Distance:** How many light-years will light travel during your remaining lifetime? (e.g., "Light will travel another 60 light-years during your life")
* [x]  **Earth Rotations:** The number of times the Earth will rotate on its axis in your remaining time.
* [x]  **DNA Replications:** The number of times your cells will copy their DNA in your remaining lifetime.
* [x]  **Planck Time Units:** Your remaining life measured in the smallest possible time units (5.39×10^−44 seconds).
*   **Protein Foldings:** The number of protein folding events that will occur in your body's cells.
* [x]  **Brain Synapse Firings:** The number of neural synaptic connections that will fire in your brain (estimated at 100 trillion per second).
